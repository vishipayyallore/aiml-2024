## Few Points

Your code looks well-structured and functional, but here are a few suggestions to improve it:

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Improve error handling by providing more detailed error messages or logging. This will help in debugging issues that may arise during service calls.

2. **Dependency Injection:**
   - Consider injecting the `ITextAnalyticsService` instances into the classes that require them, rather than creating instances directly. This promotes better testability and flexibility.

3. **Logging:**
   - Introduce logging to capture important events, especially when making HTTP requests or handling exceptions. This will be helpful for troubleshooting in production.

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Refine how configuration is managed. Currently, you are passing `IConfiguration` to the services. Consider creating a configuration class or using strongly-typed options for better maintainability.

5. **Async/Await Best Practices:**
   - Ensure that async/await best practices are followed. In particular, the methods should have an "Async" suffix to indicate that they are asynchronous.

6. **Code Comments:**
   - Consider adding comments to explain complex logic or to provide information about specific sections of the code. This can be especially helpful for someone else reading or maintaining the code.

7. **Dispose Pattern:**
   - Implement the `IDisposable` pattern where necessary. For example, consider disposing of the `HttpClient` instance or using it as a singleton.

8. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Ensure that each class has a clear and single responsibility. For instance, the `TextAnalyticsServiceRest` class is responsible for making REST API calls, but it also handles storing the detected language. Consider separating these concerns.

9. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior. Ensure that the userText is not null or empty before making calls.

10. **Constants:**

- Consider using constants for string literals like "quit" or other repeated values to enhance maintainability.
